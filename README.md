A demo of the bug that causes portability issues in `rules_js`:

error TS2742: The inferred type of 'Offline' cannot be named without a reference to '.aspect_rules_js/@myorg+c@0.0.0/node_modules/@myorg/c/qux'. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
```

The reasons seems to be there is no linkage underneath `node_modules`:
